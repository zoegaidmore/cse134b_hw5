# Part 3:
## What enhancements I made to my site:

### Change #1(?):
Iâ€™m not entirely sure if this change counts, because it was made regarding the first part of this HW 5 assignment. After making the project-cards, I made sure that the cards matched my site being in light or dark mode: I changed the background and text color on the cards depending on the mode, to ensure that they were cohesive with the rest of the project. 

### Change #2:
Previously, on the Contact page of my site, I had a list of links to social media. I changed these links to be images of the social media logo, which act as links and take the user to my account when pressed.

### Change #3:
I added functionality to a "Show Code" button on my Projects page, which I had created during HW 1. Now, when pressed, the button calls a javascript function in my script.js file and shows a block of code! I then added a "Hide Code" button which appears with the code block, and calls a javascript function to hide the code again when it is pressed.
