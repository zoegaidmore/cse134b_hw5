# Part 3:
## What enhancements I made to my site:

Iâ€™m not entirely sure if this change counts because it was made regarding the first part of this HW 5 assignment. After making the project-cards, I made sure that the background and text color of my cards matched my site being in light or dark mode. The next change I made was to the list of links to social media that I have on my Contacts page. I changed these links to be images of the social media logo, which act as links and take the user to my account when pressed. Thirdly, I added functionality to a "Show Code" button on my Projects page, which I had created during HW 1. Now, when pressed, the button calls a javascript function in my script.js file and shows a block of code! I then added a "Hide Code" button which appears with the code block, and calls a javascript function to hide the code again when it is pressed. Possibly the change that I'm most proud of is to the "Music" section of my "Interests" page: I created an image that switches between my favorite albums's covers, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Lastly, I made minor tweaks to layouts of my pages, for example, making sure that all of my grey text boxes were aligned and the same height.
